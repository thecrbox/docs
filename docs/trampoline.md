# Welcome!

You're here because you're setting up your *thecrbox*. Great!

## Why?

To access all features (e.g. fine-tune the PID if needed), *thecrbox* must be accessible via Wi-Fi
network you plan to control it with. There’s no dedicated Android/iOS app -- you’ll enter your Wi-Fi
details during setup.

If you don't need Wi-Fi, you can [force your device into offline mode][ui-offlinemode] instead of provisioning it.

## Can it go wrong?

Wi-Fi names and passwords are case-sensitive.

In case you entered wrong credentials and *thecrbox* does not join your network, you can always
[force factory reset][factoryreset] and try again.
