# Welcome!

You got here because you're setting up your *thecrbox*.


## Why?

To access all features (e.g. fine-tune the PID if needed), *thecrbox* must be accessible via Wi-Fi network you plan to control it with. 

There’s no dedicated Android/iOS app -- you’ll enter your Wi-Fi details during setup.

## Can it go wrong?

Wi-Fi names and passwords are case-sensitive.

In case you entered wrong credentials and *thecrbox* does not join your network, you can always [force factory reset][factoryreset] and try again.
